As a child, my family and I would visit the cozy little Chinatown patisseries in New York. I would gaze for hours behind the window glass admiring the detail and artistry of the creative cakes and colorful confections. Who knew food could be so beautiful? Those moments of awe would spark a culinary flight from my youth all the way to present day. And that spark is sparkling brighter than ever. I have studied at the French Culinary Institute in NYC, mastering the Fondant technique. I've baked for family, friends, co-workers, weddings and events, capturing the technique and form of baking. I'll be a busy bee, baking you a cake you'll surely enjoy!
